# Simple neural network

This program is able to create a simple neural network, defining a number of hidden layers, inputs and outputs.
Working with a sigmoid as an activation function in every neuron, the output layer will try to get as close as possible to the outputs first defined; this could be called as supervised learning.
Really basic first steps of AI.
