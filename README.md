# redSimple

This program is able to create a simple neural network, defining a number of hidden layers, inputs and outputs.
Working with a sigmoid as an activation function in every neuron, the output layer will try to get as close as possible to the outputs first defined; this could be called as supervised learning.
Any comment, critic or errors found, will be welcomed. I'll try to keep improving the code and making it easier to read, right now it's kind of a mess.
